# Field Finder

Field Finder is a tool that allows you to search for various crop fields near your location. To search simply do the following:

1. Select the types of fields you wish to find
2. Set the search radius
3. Click on the map where you are located/where you wish to center your search from
4. Press the 'Search' button

Field Finder will then find all fields that meet your criteria and list them for you. If you wish to inspect a field in greater detail, you can click on it to find more information.

Under the hood, I am leveraging the [USDA ARMS API](https://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/data-apis/arms-data-api/) to gather field/crop information.

This application was initially inspired by my friends and I when we were out dove hunting in an area we were unfamiliar with. It can be hard to determine what areas to explore, especially when you are in a new area. Knowing what crops are around you and where can help a lot in determining whether or not a hunting location is viable for doves and other upland birds.

A commercial product [onX](https://www.onxmaps.com/) has very similar features/use cases, but it is a paid application/service with a much larger scope than **Field Finder**. I am simply trying to make a simple way for someone to determine what types of fields are close to them (for now...).
